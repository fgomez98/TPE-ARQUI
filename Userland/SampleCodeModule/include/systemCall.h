arg1: can be WRITE (1) or READ (2), deterines if the systcall will be to put or retrieve from screen.
arg2: STDIN (0), STDOUT (1), CLOCK (2) & BEEP (3). It defines where it will access, Screen, Clock or Speaker.
arg3: Used to define which type of outpt will be selected when arg2 is STDOUT (putStr, putChar, deleteChar, etc), the type of beep when accesing clock,
 or works as a pointer to fetch a character when called in RREAD mode.
arg4, arg5 &a arg6:multi use arguments, used to send values to kernel containing, for exampe, coodinates for printing a pixel or a given colour, or retrieving hours, minutes or seconds with getTime.
